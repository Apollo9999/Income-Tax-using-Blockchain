# Income-Tax-using-Blockchain

Blockchain is an ideal technology which could disrupt the Indian Tax System by overcoming all the roadblocks previously mentioned. Our idea includes the following features:

(i) Tracking where and when tax  has been paid, and in doing so reduce tax fraud .

(ii) Helping multinational companies provide a consistent data set for multiple tax authorities

(iii) Adds value within a business, between businesses & between businesses and governments

(iv) Giving tax authorities and other regulators more confidence in the data supplied to them. 

(v)Giving more visibility to micro transactions such as those done by individuals as part of the sharing economy.

In addition, this system also features an user friendly interface which enables every citizen of the country to potentially know how his contributed tax has been put in use .
