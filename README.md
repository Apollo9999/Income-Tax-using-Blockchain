Motive and Objective of selecting the usecase of Income Tax

Blockchain has the power and scope to disrupt and strongly reorganize accounting and the way tax payments are processed. As the technology is still in its infancy, introducing Blockchain to the tax authorities would require a revolution in both governmental databases and network systems.

Blockchain could be innovative for the industry and will transform the finance function.

►Will change be driven or even mandated by governments?

►How quickly will businesses adopt?

►How will tax professionals fit in?

►Future roles may require financial, tax and technical experience.

►It is vital to understand how governments are using blockchain to collect tax due.

►Mistakes and fraud could be reduced greatly.

►Could the tax function be replaced by blockchain’s secure, certain and real-time ledger? ►Tax professionals and tax compliance administrators may need to become blockchaintechnologists.

►Tax knowledge still will be required to build, install and maintain systems.
